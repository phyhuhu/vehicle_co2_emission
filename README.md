# CO2 Emission of Vehicles in USA

In this project, I would like to study the CO2 emission of vehicles in the US. 

The data are from https://www.epa.gov/compliance-and-fuel-economy-data/data-cars-used-testing-fuel-economy.

I build a model by linear regression to predict the CO2 emission of vehicles in 2011.
